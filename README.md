<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![DriveAware Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]

DriveAware aims to revolutionize road safety for young drivers by utilizing smartphone technology for real-time driving data collection. Unlike previous solutions that relied on expensive hardware installations in vehicles, DriveAware harnesses the sensors and capabilities of smartphones, allowing for affordable and accessible driver monitoring. 

### Key Benefits:
- **Affordable and Convenient**: Removes the need for physical devices, leveraging smartphones to reduce both costs and complexity for users.
- **Comprehensive Insights**: Provides detailed feedback on driving behaviors such as speed, acceleration, braking, and route patterns, offering users valuable insights into their driving.
- **Increased Safety**: Includes cognitive reaction tests before each drive to ensure drivers are in a safe mental state, helping to prevent impaired driving.
- **Eco-Friendly**: By eliminating the need for external hardware, DriveAware significantly reduces electronic waste, promoting a sustainable approach to driver safety.
- **Data-Driven Scoring**: Aggregated data generates a driving score that parents or guardians can monitor, with potential benefits such as reduced insurance premiums for safe driving practices.

### Features:
- **Real-Time Tracking and Notifications**: Tracks driving parameters and notifies users about risky behaviors in real-time.
- **Secure Data Handling**: Implements robust encryption and privacy measures to ensure secure storage and transmission of user data.
- **Subscription Management**: Allows users to easily manage their subscription plans, including options to upgrade, downgrade, or cancel as needed.
- **User Support**: Provides dedicated customer support to address any issues with app functionality or troubleshooting.

DriveAware offers a cost-effective, convenient, and sustainable solution for improving driver safety. This new app-based approach supports young drivers and their guardians by providing valuable insights and real-time feedback, ultimately contributing to safer roads.
